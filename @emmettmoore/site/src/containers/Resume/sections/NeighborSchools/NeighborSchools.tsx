        NeighborSchools works with prospective child care providers to help them
        open and operate their own in-home programs. I joined NeighborSchools as
        the first employee to build a web application that helps child care
        professionals open licensed daycare programs in their homes.

        I designed and implemented a billing solution that processed over $10M
        transactions, developed a comprehensive GraphQL API for our app using
        Apollo Server / Apollo Client, and built a custom CRM for tracking our
        relationships with parents and child care providers. I also managed our
        engineering hiring process and provided strategic research and technical
        guidance to our SEO efforts.
